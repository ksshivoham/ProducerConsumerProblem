# ProducerConsumerProblem
Consideraproducer-consumersituation, whereaprocessPproducesanintegerusingthefunction produceNext() and sends it to process C. Process C receives the integer from P and consumes it in the function consumeNext(). After consuming this integer, C must let P know, and P must produce the next integer only after learning that C has consumed the earlier one. Assume that P and C get a pointer to a shared memory segment of 8 bytes, that can store anytwo4-byteinteger-sizedﬁelds,asshownbelow. Bothﬁeldsinthesharedmemorystructure arezeroedoutinitially. PandCcanreadorwritefromit,justastheywouldwithanyotherdata object. Brieﬂydescribehowyouwouldsolvetheproducer-consumerproblemdescribedabove, using only this shared memory as a means of communication and synchronization between processes P and C. You must not use any other synchronization or communication primitive. You are provided template code below which gets a pointer to the shared memory, and produces/consumes integers. You must write the code for communicating the integer between the processes using the shared memory, with synchronization logic as required
